# üß†üêü ZebrafishSNN

**ZebrafishSNN** is a simulation framework for modeling the sensorimotor control of swimming in zebrafish using spiking neural networks (SNNs). This repository integrates biologically inspired neural models, mechanical simulations, and experimental data to analyze locomotor behaviors in virtual zebrafish within static and dynamic aquatic environments.


## üß™ Features

- Biologically inspired spiking neural networks

- Integration with FARMS for physics-based swimming

- Data-driven neuronal parameters optimization

- Position control and Torque control

- Closed-loop sensorimotor analyses
